	<h1>DCue</h1>
	<p>DCue is an open source command line tool for creating audio cue sheet files using the massive release database at Discogs.com. DCue is available for both Windows and Linux and is written in C++ with no external library dependencies. It has a very simple command line syntax and creates human-readable and universally compatible cue sheets (.cue files). It also supports the automatic creation of multiple cue sheets for multi-disc albums in an intuitive way. Currently at version 1.0, DCue is already considered relatively functional.</p>

	<p>Because of the niche appeal of DCue and because I'm the starving artist type, if you find the project useful, a donation would be greatly appreciated. Any money donated is purely a "thank you" and will probably buy me a drink or two. :)</p>
